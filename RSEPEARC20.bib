@conference{Baxter12,
  title    = "The Research Software Engineer",
  abstract = "Research is increasingly digital. Twenty-first century research has been characterised by the rise of digital methods, the third and fourth paradigms of science – computational simulation and data-intensive research. In their turn, these new approaches are both built on a common foundation – computer software.Yet despite this increasing reliance on software in research, professional practices for developing research software in academia lag far behind those in the commercial sector. Computational research tools are often fragile, generally not sustainable or usable beyond the lifetime of a given project, and frequently unsuitable for scrutiny. Those trained solely within academia often employ ad-hoc or casual development techniques. Institutions miss out on opportunities to increase the impact of their research by producing robust software deliverables that could be used and cited by their peers.Computational work must reflect the committed attitude of experimentalists towards caring about precise, professional, repeatable, meticulous work – no-one with the same casual attitude to experimental instrumentation as many researchers have to code would be allowed anywhere near a lab. This is striking considering how often research results now depend on software.Software engineering professionals are trained in best practices, and in the best commercial institutions follow a disciplined approach to the design, construction, testing and maintenance of software systems. Attempts to leverage these skills within academia by employing contract programmers typically fail, due to otherwise talented programmers lacking sufficient research experience and a necessary appreciation of the significant cultural differences between business and academia. Software engineers that do have research experience and good knowledge of the underlying domain are, however, in very short supply, due to the lack of appropriate institutional homes and career progression paths for their work.This paper provides a synthesis of discussions that took place during and after the 2012 Collaborations Workshop organized by the Software Sustainability Institute in Oxford, UK.",

@article{Hahn2005,
  abstract     = {Comparison of whole genomes has revealed that changes in the size of gene families among organisms is quite common. However, there are as yet no models of gene family evolution that make it possible to estimate ancestral states or to infer upon which lineages gene families have contracted or expanded. In addition, large differences in family size have generally been attributed to the effects of natural selection, without a strong statistical basis for these conclusions. Here we use a model of stochastic birth and death for gene family evolution and show that it can be efficiently applied to multispecies genome comparisons. This model takes into account the lengths of branches on phylogenetic trees, as well as duplication and deletion rates, and hence provides expectations for divergence in gene family size among lineages. The model offers both the opportunity to identify large-scale patterns in genome evolution and the ability to make stronger inferences regarding the role of natural selection in gene family expansion or contraction. We apply our method to data from the genomes of five yeast species to show its applicability.},

The survey provides much needed demographic information about the education, ﬁeld, gender, job satisfaction and career plans of the people of RSEs. The community is found to be highly educated, derive mainly from the hard sciences, and to be predominantly male. Respondents report satisfaction in their jobs, but indicate that career progression is both difﬁcult and opaque. This paper supports a continued discussion about the experience of RSEs and recommends further investigation into this important community.},
